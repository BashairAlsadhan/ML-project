# ParkSmart - Practical Machine Learning Course

With rising student numbers and limited parking, efficient management is critical. Currently, parking at KSU relies on outdated "blind search" methods, causing delays and congestion as students and faculty hunt for spots.

Our solution? Drone-captured aerial footage, analyzed to identify open spaces and peak usage patterns. By mapping preferred spots, high-traffic areas, and congestion times, our project offers a data-driven approach to streamline parking. We've also surveyed the campus community to ensure our solution directly addresses their challenges.

Workflow Overview:

1. Drone footage capture
2. Footage processing to identify open spots
3. Analysis to map occupancy patterns
4. Data visualization and feedback for continuous improvement
